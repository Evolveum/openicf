<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identity Connectors
Project -
Roles &amp;
Governance<br>
</span></font>
<p>The Identity Connectors project is modeled after the&nbsp;<a
 href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net">GlassFish project</a> which has a
very flat,
lightweight governance structure. Decisions are made in public
discussion on public mailing lists. There are few formal roles--an
individual's word carries weight in accordance with their
contribution to the project. Decisions are made by consensus, rather
than voting--most decisions are of interest only to members of the
community who will be affected by it. The combination of public
mailing lists and consensus ensures that any person who could be
affected by a decision both finds out about it, and has a voice in
the discussion.<br>
</p>
<h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>There are quite a few ways to participate in the Identity Connectors 
project and community, and not all of them involve contributing
source code to the project! Simply using the connectors,
participating on mailing lists, or filing bug reports or enhancement
requests is an incredibly valuable form of participation. </p>
<p>The roles of participation are as follows:
Users, Contributors, Committers, Maintainers, and
Project Lead.</p>
<p><b>Users</b> </p>
<p>Users are the people who use the Connectors.
Users are using
the
software, reporting bugs, making feature requests and suggestions. This
is by far the most important category of people. Without users, there
is no reason for the project.</p>
<p><i>How to become one:</i> Download and use
it.<span

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>Contributors</b></p>
<p>Contributors are individuals who contribute to the Identity Connectors project,
but do
not have Subversion write access to the source tree. Contributions can
be in
the form of source code patches, new code, or bug reports, but could
also include web site content like articles, FAQs, or screenshots. </p>
<p>A contributor who has sent in solid, useful source code
patches on a project can be elevated to committer status by the
maintainer. </p>
<p>Integration of a Contributors' submissions is at the discretion
of the project maintainer, but this is an iterative, communicative
process. Note that for code to be integrated, a completed Sun
Contribution Agreement (SCA) is
required from each contributor. See the <a
 href="GovernancePolicy.html#SCA_Policy">SCA
policy</a> for info. </p>
<p><i>How to become one:</i>
Contribute in any of the ways
described above: either code, examples, web site updates, tests, bugs,
and patches. If you're interested in becoming a Committer to the source
base, get the sources, make an improvement or
fix a bug,
and send that code to the developers mailing list or attach it to the
bug report in Issue Tracker.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Committers</b></p>
<p>Developers have Subversion write access to the source tree, either
for
the individual modules they are working on, or in some cases global
write permissions everywhere in Subversion. </p>
<p>A developer must complete and send in a S form to commit code. See
the <a
 href="GovernancePolicy.html#SCA_Policy">SCA
policy</a> for
info. </p>
<p>Rules for how to commit, once you have commit access, will vary
by module. Be sure to ask before you start making changes!</p>
<p><i>How to become one:</i> Submit some patches via
email, and ask the maintainer of the code you've patched for commit
access. The maintainer will seek consensus before granting Committer
access, but their decisions are final.</p>
<p><b>Maintainers</b> </p>
<p>Each module has one maintainer, who has check-in permissions
(either for that module or globally), and "manages" a group of <i>Committers</i>.
They are responsible for merging contributors' patches, bug fixes, and
new code from the development branch of the source tree into the stable
branch. Maintainers are responsible for making sure that these
contributions do not break the build. </p>
<p>The Maintainer is also responsible for checking that everyone
who contributes code has submitted a SCA. See the <a
 href="GovernancePolicy.html#SCA_Policy">SCA
policy</a> for
info. </p>
<p>A Maintainer is responsible for their module (accessible using
Subversion), and for granting check-in privileges to contributors. They
also
act as the "police force" of the module, helping to ensure quality
across the build.</p>
<p><i>How to become one:</i> </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start a module (you need to have
written some working code on your project to do this, you'll also need
to talk to the Project Lead).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have responsibility for that
module handed over to you from the current Maintainer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take over an abandoned project--sometimes someone starts
something, but for one reason or another can't continue to work on it.
If it's interesting to you, volunteer! </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Project Lead</b></p>
<p>The Identity Connectors project has an overall Project
Lead. This Project Lead is currently appointed by Sun. They are
responsible for managing the entire project, helping to create
policies by consensus that ensure global quality.<br>
