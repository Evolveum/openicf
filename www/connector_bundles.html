 <h1>Connector Bundles</h1>
 <p>A bundle is nothing more than a specialized JAR. There are
  special attributes within the JAR's manifest that are recognized
  by the connectors framework. This document describes the plan for connector bundles and
 classloading strategy.
 The goals are as follows:
 <ol>
     <li><p>Eliminate classloading conflicts.<p>Connectors are
     the point of integration with third-party systems. This
     inherently introduces a number of dependencies on third-party
     jars. As the number of dependencies increase, the chance of
a class conflict increases as well. </p></li>
     <li><p>Support different versions of the same connector from
     a single provisioner. <p>Often you will have different
     versions of the same resource that need to be managed from
     the same provisioner. In these cases, you will typically
     have multiple versions of the same third-party class and
     they need to reside in the same JVM.</li>
     <li><p>Better patch model for delivering hotfixes.
     <p>By their very nature, connectors are one of the most
     error prone areas of the system, requiring more hotfixes
     than any other component. It is essential that we provide
     a way to deliver a patch without impacting other components
     in the system or other connectors.</p>
     </li>
 </ol>
 <p>For these reasons, each connector will have its own classloader.
 Bundles are the deployable unit for a connector that contain
 the connector class and dependencies, thus defining the
 contents of a connector's classloader.</p>
  <h3><A NAME="Structure">Bundle Structure</A></h3>
  <p>This section summarizes the basic structure of a connector bundle (for an example target resource called <b>Foo</b>):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>src/org/identityconnectors/foo (directory)</b><p>The source file directory, containg all Java resources and classes for this bundle.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>FooConfiguration.java</b>   The main Configuration class for the connector, which contains annotated ConfigurationProperties (@ConfigurationProperty).</p>
        <li><p><b>FooConnection.java</b>   The underlying Connection object that the Connector will manage.</p>
        <li><p><b>FooConnectionFactory.java</b>   A factory to create and provide new Connections to the framework.</p>
        <li><p><b>FooConnector.java</b>   The actual Connector, which draws a Connection from the framework's connection pool, and performs operations on it.</p>
        <li><p><b>FooFilterTranslator.java</b>   An implementation of AbstractFilterTranslator which allows you to perform native search optimization by mapping the 
        framework's generic search contructs to your resource-specific implementation.</p>
        <li><p><b>FooConnectorTests.java</b>   A class of white-box tests to exercise your Connector implementation.</p>
        <li><p><b>Messages.properties</b>   Maps ConfigurationProperty keys (from the Configuration class) to specific messages and labels for display in the application's UI.</p>
    </ul>
    <li><b>lib/ (directory)</b><p>Contains JARs (or bundles) to distribute with this Connector. Anything in this directory is automatically added to the classpath at runtime (via
    the framework's custom classloader).</p>
        <ul><li><p><b>build/ (subdirectory)</b>   Libraries only available on the build classpath (will not be distributed).</p>
            <li><p><b>test/ (subdirectory)</b>   Libraries only available on the test classpath (will not be distributed).</p>
        </ul>
    <li><b>build.properties</b><p>Contains build properties for this Connector. The basic properties are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>MAJOR=1</b>  The major release version.</p>
        <li><p><b>MINOR=0</b>  The minor release version.</p>
        <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion=1.0</b>  The <i><b>minimum</b></i> required framework version for this connector. Newer framework versions will be <a href="/design.html#compatibility">backwards compatible</a>.</p>
        <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Name=org.identityconnectors.foo</b>  The unique name for this Connector Bundle (usually its package name).</p>
      </ul>
    <li><b>build.xml</b><p>The build file for the Connector. This file references <i>connector_build.xml</i> in the framework.</p>   
  </ul>    
  <h3>Inside the Bundle JAR</h3>
  <p>Once built, the bundle becomes a self-contained JAR, with internals as follows:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF (file)</b><p>This is the manifest. You will notice it contains
        some of the special attributes declared in the <i>build.properties</i> file. Here is a list of the core bundle
  attributes (used by all bundles, regardless
  of whether they declare any connectors):</p>
  <ul>
      <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion: </b>   The minimum version of the framework required by the connector. If the version
        is greater than the version of the deployment, an error will be thrown.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Name: </b> Qualified name for the connector bundle. Within a given deployment, the
         pair (<i>ConnectorBundle-Name</i>,<i>ConnectorBundle-Version</i>) must be unique.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Version: </b>  The version of the bundle. Within a given deployment, the
         pair (<i>ConnectorBundle-Name</i>,<i>ConnectorBundle-Version</i>)
         must be unique.</p>
       </li>
  </ul>
      
      
      <li><b>lib/ (directory)</b><p>The libraries (or bundles) distributed with the connector. These 
      are automatically added to the classpath of the bundle at runtime. (This is a non-standard JAR feature, provided by the connectors
      class loader).</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p><b>**/* (files)</b></p><p>Source files, classes, and Java resources.
      (These are standard JAR features). These are intentionally kept
      as top-level entities to allow you to compile downstream
      dependencies against the classes within a bundle by simply adding
      the bundle to your build's classpath. This is to facilitate
      extending a connector (see "Extending a Connector" below).
      </p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Connector Registration</h3>
  The connector bundle manifest is used merely for the purpose of
  establishing the classpath and class loader for the bundle. All other meta-data
  is controlled via Java annotations defined by the Connectors Framework. 
  In order to register a connector, its class must be present in a 
  connector bundle and must have the annotation
  <code>org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.ConnectorClass</code>.
  As an implementation note, the Connector Framework scans the top level <i>.class</i>
  files in a connector bundle, looking for classes that have the <code>@ConnectorClass</code>
  annotation, thus auto-discovering connectors which are defined in the bundle.
  

  <h3>Class Loading</h3>

  <p>Each bundle has its own class loader which resolves classes
  in the following order:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Classes in the bundle</li>
      <li>Classes in JARs in the bundle's lib directory, in alphabetical order.
      Note that the JARS in the bundle's lib directory may themselves be bundles
      which have their own lib directory. These will be recursively processed
      and added to the classpath in depth-first-search order.
      </li>
      <li>Classes in the framework's classloader (and parent class loaders).</li>
  </ol>

  As an implementation detail, each bundle will get a BundleClassLoader.
  A BundleClassLoader is a (subclass of) URLClassLoader where the URLs are the
  top-level directory of the bundle, the jars in its lib folder, and the
  same for each of the embedded bundles. The BundleClassLoader
  will have, as a parent class loader, the ClassLoader that loaded the connectors
  framework. The BundleClassLoader will override the appropriate methods such
  that child class loading happens before parent. In addition, when fetching
  a class from the parent class loader, it will restrict it such that
  the class cannot access any internal framework classes.

  <h4>ContextClassLoader</h4>
  <p>
  The context class loader (<code>Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()</code>)
  must be set such that during any invocation to
  a connector method, the connector's class loader is the context class loader.
  It will be the responsibility of the ConnectorFacade to arrange for this.
  At the beginning of any invocation to a connector method it should be set
  and at the end, it should be restored to its previous value.
  </p>
  <h3>Deployment in a WAR</h3>
  When deploying in a war, the connector framework jar(s) should be
  placed in WEB-INF/lib. The bundles themselves (also .jars) should be placed in
  a "/bundles" directory at the root of the web application.
  <p>
  The bundles will be autodiscovered there and the connector API will
  provide a way to list the bundles, create connectors from the bundles, etc.
  <p>

  <h3>Extending a Connector</h3>
  <p>
  One of the things we allow for is the ability to extend (subclass) a given
  connector. The way to do this is to add the extended bundle to the <code>lib</code>
  directory of a new bundle and create a class which subclasses the target class.</p>
  
  <p>The DatabaseConnector is a great example of this. The common logic would be in a common bundle as follows:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><p>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion:</b> 1.0</p>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Name:</b> org.identityconnectors.database.common</p>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Version:</b> 1.0</p>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <li><p>org.identityconnectors/database/common/AbstractDatabaseConnector.class</p>
          <ul>
              <li><p><b>NOTE</b>: this connector would <b>not</b> have a @ConnectorClass annotation.</p></li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>org/identityconnectors/database/common/* (other common source files)</p>
      <li><p>lib/</p>
  </ul>
  <p>Then there would be as many database (resource) specific bundles as necessary, for example:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><p>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion:</b> 1.0</p>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Name:</b> org.identityconnectors.database.mysql</p>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Version:</b> 1.0</p>
        </ul>
      </li>
           
      <li><p>org/identityconnectors/database/mysql/MySQLConnector.class (subclass of AbstractDatabaseConnector)</p>
          <ul>
              <li><p><b>NOTE</b>: this connector <b>would</b> have a @ConnectorClass annotation</p>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>org/identityconnectors/database/mysql/* (other MySQL source files)</p>
       <li><p>lib/org.identityconnectors.database.common-1.0.jar (this is the bundle described above)
      <li><p>lib/* (any specific database drivers and libraries as needed)</p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Distribution of Connectors</h3>
  <p>As much as possible, connectors will be distributed in the form of connector
  bundles. However there are cases where we may need to remove third-party
  JARs from the bundles we distribute. For these cases, upon deployment,
  you will need to re-jar the distributed bundle with the required dependencies.</p>

  <h3><A NAME="Versions">Handling Multiple Resource Versions</A></h3>
  <p>A connector should document which versions of the
  target resource it supports, and these are expected to evolve and mature over time.
  For the sake of this example, we will use the fictional
  vendor Humanitrobe. Let's say they have two major product versions to
  support, Humanitrobe 8.x and their new release, Humanitrobe 9.x. Let's also assume that
  we do not have the right to distribute the humanitrobe8x.jar or the
  humanitrobe9x.jar. We already have a HumanitrobeConnector v1.0
  in place which supports Humanitrobe 8.x. Regardless of whether their API has changed from release to release, 
  when we have a new version of the same resource, the obvious and intended solution is to produce
  a new version of the same Connector.</p>
    
  <p>In this case we would distribute two seperate bundles:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><p>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion:</b> 1.0</p></li>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Name:</b> org.identityconnectors.humanitrobe</p></li>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Version:</b> 1.0 <b>#supports 8.x</b></p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>    
      <li><p>org/identityconnectors/humanitrobe/HumanitrobeConnector.class (and other sources)</p>
      <li><p>lib/ (directory is empty for distro)<i></i></p>
  </ul>
  and
    <ul>
      <li><p>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion:</b> 1.0</p></li>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Name:</b> org.identityconnectors.humanitrobe</p></li>
            <li><p><b>ConnectorBundle-Version:</b> 1.1 <b>#supports 9.x</b></p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>     
      <li><p>org/identityconnectors/humanitrobe/HumanitrobeConnector.class (and other sources)</p>
 
      <li><p>lib/ (directory is empty for distro)<i></i></p>
  </ul>
  <p>Upon deployment these bundles would be re-packaged and the humanitrobe[8x/9x].jar would be added to the lib directories, accordingly.</p>
  <p>On a side note, keep in mind that a new version of a Connector may require a new version of the framework, but a new version of 
  the framework will never require newer versions of individual Connectors. Thus, framework upgrades should be harmless to existing 
  deployments.</p>

<h3>Patching Connectors</h3>
<p>
One of the goals of connectors is to provide an easier patch
process. In general, when a customer requests a patch it is for a 
specific connector, rather than a fix to a shared component. If the fix is 
to a shared component, they would rather that not impact other connectors 
in the system (unless they explictly ask for it). For this case the choice 
has traditionally been either a)copy and paste the common component into the 
patch or b)change the common component and hope for the best. This is solved in Connectors 
by the fact that each connector bundle is completely self-contained. A bundle 
and all of its dependencies are a single unit.
</p>

<p>This functionality becomes even more important in the future
once the framework is relatively mature and stable. The end goal is to allow
customers to grab connectors off of the trunk and drop them into their deployment 
from a prior release (see <a href="#Versions">Handling Multiple Resource Versions</a>). 
As long as the <i>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion</i> of the connector on
the trunk is compatible with what the customer has in their deployment,
they should be able to do this. In this case, you can see it
is critical that bundles are self contained.</p>

<h3>Build Notes</h3>
<p>From a build standpoint, one thing we have done is structure our bundle
manifests so that the version is automatically populated. For each
bundle, there is a bundle.properties (see <A HREF="#Structure">Bundle Structure</A>). 
The attribute <i>ConnectorBundle-Version</i> will be left out since it will be
determined by a global setting passed in by the build machine.
The attribute <i>ConnectorBundle-FrameworkVersion</i> will be left
hard-coded for now. We should rarely bump this up and, when we do,
we need to do so in a controlled fashion.</p>

<p>Also, as implied in the previous section, the names of our bundle.jars
must include the full version number.</p>
