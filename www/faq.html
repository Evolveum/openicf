   	<H3>What are Connectors?</H3>
   	<P>Connectors provide applications with a way to decouple from the resources that they connect to. The Identity
   	Connectors Framework is aimed at user provisioning and identity management, but is generalized enough to support
   	several different kinds of applications. For example, in addition to basic CRUD operations, the API supports Search,
   	Sync, Authenticate, and Scripting operations, as well as others.</P>
   	<P>
   	Connectors themselves are self-contained <a href="/connector_bundles.html">bundles</a> that ride on top of the Connectors Framework.
   	Applications are completely separated from the bundles, so that different implementations can be swapped in and out without affecting
   	the app or its dependencies. 
   	</P>
   	<H3>What are the goals of this project?</H3>
   	<P>At a high level: Provide a generic layer between applications and target resources.</P>
   	<P>At a lower level:</P>
   	<ul>
   		<li>Offer generic features that are less resource-specific
   		<li>Extract common functionality out to the framework (reduce duplication in resource adapters)
   		<li>Server independence
   		<li>More frequent release cycle
   		<li>Continuous testing and improvement
   	</ul>
   	<H3>What features does the Connectors Framework provide?</H3>
   	<ul>
   		<li>Connection pooling
		<li>Timeouts on all operations
		<li>Search filtering
		<li>Search and sync buffering and streaming of results
		<li>Scripting through Groovy and Boo .NET
		<li>Classloader and JVM Isolation
		<li>Independent logging API/SPI (much like Apache Commons logging)
		<li>Support for two programming platforms (Java/.NET)
		<li>Opt-in operations that support simple and advanced implementations on the same CRUD operation
		<li>Logging proxy that captures all API calls
		<li><a href="/Java_Toolkit.html">Toolkit</a> to create connectors with support for Ant, NetBeans and Eclipse
   	</ul>
   	<p>See the <a href="/design.html">design overview</a> for more information on the framework architecture.</p>
