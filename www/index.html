  <h3>About</h3>
<p>The Identity Connectors Framework and Toolkit is built to help drive development of
Connectors. Connectors provide a consistent generic layer between
applications and target resources. The main focus of the API is
provisioning operations and password management. The toolkit is intended
to facilitate development with as few dependences as possible.</p>

<p>One of the main features of the framework is decoupling
Connectors from any application that uses them. This means each
Connector implementation can be easily replaced and not necessarily
depend on a specific version of the framework. In addition an
application may choose to use multiple Connectors which can require
class path isolation. With class path isolation there is no
issue with conflicting 3rd party libraries. An application is only be
required to couple to the Framework and not to any specific Connector.
