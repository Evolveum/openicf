<h3>Contributing Code</h3>
<p>Contributing to project Identity Connectors can be done in various
ways: bug fixes, enhancements, new features for existing connectors, or
a brand new connector.</p>
<ul>
	<li>All contributors must sign and return a <a
 href="https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/GovernancePolicy.html#SCA_Policy">Contributor
Agreement</a>
	<li>See the <a href="https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/GovernancePolicy.html">governance
policy</a> for more information on roles and responsibilities.
	<li>To have commit privileges, you must first be
granted the Developer role. To get started, submit some patches via
email, and then ask the owner/maintainer of the connector for commit
access. The maintainer will seek consensus before granting the role,
but their decision is final. In case of dispute, the community
leader is responsible to resolve conflicts and to bring conclusion to
the issue.
	<li>All code checked into the workspace must follow
the <a href="/conventions.html">coding conventions</a>.
	<li>If you don't yet have the Developer role, see the
process for providing a patch, below.
	<li>Developers must follow commit procedures when
updating the workspace.
</ul>

<h3>Providing a Patch</h3>
<p>Well-described, easy-to-apply patches are a pleasure for other
developers to encounter and go a long way towards making the connectors
more stable and powerful. The first step to submitting a patch is
to sign and return <a href="https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/GovernancePolicy.html#SCA_Policy">Sun's
Contributor Agreement</a>. Please print this form out, fill in
all the necessary detail, and return it <a href="mailto:sun_ca@sun.com">here</a>.</p>

<ul> 
	<li>If you are not yet a member of project Identity
Connector but you have mailing list access, you can post a message
about your proposed patch to the project's developer <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing list</a>.
    <li>If you are a project Identity Connector member,
first conduct a query of the connector issue database to determine
whether this patch is associated with an already reported defect.
	<li>If your patch pertains to an existing issue, you should use the <I>Create
a New Attachment</i> link in the issue edit screen to submit your patch and
the <i>Add Comment</i> section to post an explanatory message. (Remember that
changes to issues generate automatic email messages to the issue's
owner and anyone on the cc list. All those people will receive your
message and a link to your patch.)
</ul>
<p>
If an issue does not exist, submit your patch as a new issue, using the
Patch link in the <i>Enter An Issue</i> section of the Issue Tracking
page. Note that you will need to update your workspace to use the
latest sources, rebuild the connector and we strongly encourage you to
run the contract tests to check that nothing is broken. Then create and
attach your patch file to the new issue as described here:</p>

<ol>
	<li>First, make sure you are making changes in the
most recent version of the source files -- for this, it is best to use
SVN to check out the source (on the SVN trunk), make your modifications
(but do not check them in), and then run the command:
  <PRE>svn diff -x -u &#62; myPatch.diff</PRE> to get a context-format patch for the
sources. This gives you a patch file which includes information about
the version you are patching, the filenames, and the contents of the
change. This is the preferred way to keep track of patches and makes it
easier for others to find and test your patch.
<li>To apply a patch, go to the proper directory and
run:
<PRE>patch &#60; myPatch.diff</PRE>
<li>Always include a message with your patch with the
following information:
<ul>
	<li>A description of what problem or defect you are attempting to fix, and the steps to
reproduce it, if possible.
	<li>A description of what the behavior should be with the patch in place.
	<li>A description of how the patch works, if reasonable. If a significant amount of code
is involved, include within the message that you agree to let the patch
be used under the applicable project license as part of the Identity Connectors project code.
	<li>A testcase including the jave source, scripts and documentation so we may include
this test in the connector testsuite.
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
The developer responsible for the section of code affected should
either apply the patch and mark the defect (if there is one registered)
as fixed, or reply with an objection if it does not seem safe, does not
appear to fix the problem, or there is not really a problem to begin
with. Notifications of any changes to the issues database, as well as
SVN check-ins, are automatically sent to the appropriate issue assignee
and cc'd to the SVN mailing lists, so you can monitor whether the patch
has been applied. Be sure to subscribe to at least the issue mailing
lists.</p><p>
If you do not know exactly how to fix a problem, but have an idea about
what is causing it, you can post a message about this on the developer
discussion list for other project members' suggestions or to find
someone who knows how to fix it.</p>
