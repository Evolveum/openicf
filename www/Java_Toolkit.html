    for the Java Toolkit for Connectors.

    <H3>Getting Started</H3>
    <P>The first thing to do is go to the <STRONG><A HREF="https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download center</STRONG></A>
    and grab the latest version of the Java Toolkit for Connectors. The toolkit contains the following elements:</P> 
    
    <UL>
    <LI>The Connectors Framework
    <LI>Full API & SPI Documentation 
    <LI>The Connector Contract Test Suite
    <LI>A Connector Creation Wizard 
    <LI>A Groovy Console for testing and debugging   
    </UL>
    <P>Think of this as an SDK for Connectors. It is completely Ant-based, self-contained, and <a href="#IDE">IDE-compatible</a>. The directory where you extract the toolkit
    will be your "framework home" (no need to check out and build the framework from SVN). Once you unzip the toolkit, you can start creating 
    connectors immediately by running 'ant' from the command line.</P>
    <P>The toolkit essentially functions to create the necessary files and directory structure for connector bundles, as well as a basic set of test
    scaffolding (this includes files in the bundle directory, the toolkit (framework) directory, and your <I>${user-home}</I> directory). Once this is done, 
    you will work from the bundle directory itself for the rest of the connector lifecycle. The necessary references back 
    to the framework will be automatically generated. The toolkit also includes a 'clean' target, which is effectively the opposite of 'create'; it 
    will remove all the generated files and directories associated with the specified connector bundle, essentially providing an "undo" if the need arises. </P>
    
    <H3>Basic Usage</H3>
   <PRE>ant [options] [target]</PRE>
<P>Available options:</P><UL>
    <LI><P>Type "ant -help" to see available options. There are none specific to this toolkit.</P>
    </UL>   
                           
<P>Available targets are:</P><UL>   
 
    <LI><P>"<B>create</B>"                Generates a skeleton Connector bundle in the specified directory.</P> 
                                        <UL><LI><P><B>This is the default target.</B></P></UL>                
                                                                        
    <LI><P>"<B>clean</B>"                 Deletes the specified bundle directory and all its contents.</P>
                
    <LI><P>"<B>usage</B>"                 Prints the usage information for this toolkit.</P></UL>              
       
Examples:
    <PRE>ant</PRE>      (launches the bundle creation wizard)
    <PRE>ant clean</PRE>      (prompts for a bundle directory, runs the cleanup script)
       
    <H3>Creating a new Connector</H3>
    <P>To launch the Connector creator wizard, simply navigate to your framework home (the toolkit directory, after you extract it) and type "<B>ant</B>".</P>
    <PRE>~/workspace/JavaToolkit$ ant</PRE>
    <P>This will immediately check your environment to ensure it meets the minimum requirements and then prompt you for a path (directory) for your new bundle. You don't need to create
    a new folder beforehand; the toolkit will create it for you. Or, if you are re-creating a bundle, you can enter a directory that already exists.
    <P>Next, if the directory already exists, you will be asked to confirm that you'd like to delete everything in the bundle directory and create a new bundle. You can always choose "No" if you selected the wrong directory.
    </P><P>Next you will be asked the name of the <B>resource</B> you would like to connect to. This is not the name of the entire bundle,
    just the name of the target machine or database, such as "LDAP" or "Unix". Finally, you'll have the option to enter a custom package name (or just use the default) and select which
    operations you will implement.</P><P>Once you have completed these steps, the toolkit will generate your entire bundle directory structure and source tree, with stubbed methods for the 
    interfaces you selected, as well as common helper and example methods as well. It will also generate a <A HREF="#PropsFile">properties file</A> for use with testing and a <I>bootstrap.groovy</I> script that you can 
    load up in the <A HREF="#GROOVY">Groovy Console</A> for quick and easy debugging. At this point, the connector is ready for you to begin working on, or to build immediately. For building and
    running tests, you will want to switch to the bundle directory you just created and use its local <B><I>build.xml</I></B> file. The following sections cover this in detail. You can also <A HREF="#IDE">import
    your project</A> into an IDE at this point.
    </P>
    <P>For details on the directory structure, see Step 4 on the <A HREF="development.html">manual connector development page</A>.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="Building">Building a Connector</a></H3>
    <P><B>Prerequisite:</B> The JUnit4 JAR must be on your Ant lib path. The easiest way to accomplish 
this is to download and copy junit4.jar to the $antHome/lib directory, where $antHome 
is the base install directory of Ant. You can easily find this by typing "ant -diagnostics"
at the command line.</P>
    
    <P>Building a connector is as simple as running the connector's Ant build file from within the <B>bundle directory</B>:</P>
    <PRE>~/workspace/FooBundle$ ant</PRE>
    
    <P>You can also call individual targets (such as "clean" or "compile") on your connector as well, should you want to. This is accomplished by running a 
    normal build and specifying the desired target, again from within the bundle directory:</P>
    <PRE>~/workspace/FooBundle$ ant clean</PRE>
    
    <P>See the framwork's common <I>connector_build.xml</I> file for all the available targets. There are also three (optional) ant options
    that can be set when building as well. These are:</P>
    <UL>
        <LI><P>'<B>cobertura.home</B>'  (Install
        location of Cobertura, if you have it installed and are doing a
        coverage build)</P>
        <LI><P>'<B>findbugs.home</B>'  (Install
        location of FindBugs, if you have it installed and are doing code
        analysis)</P>
        <LI><P>'<B>external.reporting</B>'  (Boolean
        indicating whether there will be an external reporting engine used for test reports)
        </P>
    </UL>
    <P>You can specify these as normal ant options, as follows:</P>
    <PRE>ant -Dfindbugs.home=/home/programs/findbugs</PRE>
    <P>As mentioned, each connector has its own <I>build.xml</I>
    file used to define the build rules. In actuality, this build
    file simply references a common build file in the framework. When you create and build connectors using this toolkit,
    the path to the framework is automatically set for you. Should you change the location of the toolkit (framework), you
    will need to specify the <B>framework.dir</B> option on your build command as well.
       
    <H3><A NAME="Tests">Running Tests</A></H3>
    <P>By default, all tests are run when you do a build on your Connector. This includes first any unit tests that you have written (white-box testing), and then
    the framework's contract test suite (black-box testing) as well. You do not have to do anything special besides putting the JUnit JAR in the right place (see
    "<A HREF="#Building">Building a Connector</A>", above) to make this happen. However, if you wish to run either of these two classes of tests independently, you certainly can.
    There are three main test targets in the build:</P><UL>
    <LI><P>"<B>test</B>" (Runs all tests)</P>
    <LI><P>"<B>run-unit-tests</B>" (Runs any user-defined unit tests)</P>
    <LI><P>"<B>run-contract-tests</B>" (Runs the framework's contract test suite to check that your connector is compliant)</P></UL>
    <P>To run the contract test suite on your connector, for example, you'd type the following (from within the bundle directory):</P>
    <PRE>~/workspace/FooBundle$ ant run-contract-tests</PRE>
    <P>Likewise, if you wanted to run only your own unit tests, you'd run:</P>
    <PRE>~/workspace/FooBundle$ ant run-unit-tests</PRE><A NAME="PropsFile"/>
    <P>When writing tests, there is a utility class you may use called TestHelpers. It loads properties from both the connector's <I>build.properties</I> file AND
    a hidden, environment-specific properties file in your "${user-home}/.connectors" directory. This allows you to extract privileged data (such as a path names or user credentials) from
    your testing code and place them in this local file. The naming convention for this file is <B>${user-home}/.connectors/${project-name}/build.groovy</B>, where ${project-name} is the ant
    project name as defined in the connector's <I>build.xml</I> file. The toolkit auto-generates this file for you, and you are free to add anything you need to it. In code
    all you need to do is call TestHelpers.getProperty() to retrieve any properties you have set.</P>
    <P>
    TestHelpers actually aggregates properties from potentially four different files, if they are present. It loads properties in the following order: <BR>
    <OL>
    <LI><P><B>${user.home}/.connectors/connectors.properties</B> //(optional) global properties file</P>
	<LI><P><B>${bundle.dir}/build.properties</B> //(required) public build properties file</P>
	<LI><P><B>${user.home}/.connectors/${project-name}/build.groovy</B> //(optional) private build properties file, also includes contract test properties</P>
	<LI><P><B>${user.home}/.connectors/${project-name}/${configuration}/build.groovy</B> //(optional) configuration-specific properties file</P>
    </OL>
    <BR>
    Properties defined in subsequent files override those defined in earlier files (the underlying structure for TestHelpers is just a standard Java Properties object). Also, you should notice
    that the latter two files are Groovy config files. These are very similar but have a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/ConfigSlurper" target="blank">different syntax</a> than standard Java properties files. The reason for this is to
    allow for greater flexibility in writing test cases and specifically for the Connectors Contract Tests.
    For more information on Groovy configuration files and the contract tests, see the <a href="contract-tests-groovy/index.html">Groovy Contract Tests</a> manual.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="GROOVY">Using the Groovy Console</A></H3>
    <P>The Groovy console is provided to allow quick and easy on-the-spot debugging of a connector. It can be launched from the <B>bundle directory</B> by
    invoking the "console" target, as follows:</P>
    <PRE>~/workspace/FooBundle$ ant console</PRE>
    <P>Since it is launched from the bundle directory, the framework gives the console access to your connector classes by adding them
    to the classpath. Once you have the console open, you can type in any arbitrary Java or Groovy code and execute it as many times as you like. In addition, 
    there is a pre-built <I>bootstrap.groovy</I> script available to help you test your connector. This will appear under the bundle directory after you create a
    connector. Feel free to modify and add your own scripts as necessary.</P><P>To open one of these scripts, simply choose <I>File -> Open</I>
    from the console's graphical menu. More information on the Groovy console can be found <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Console">here</a>.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="IDE">IDE Integration</A></H3>
    <H4>Netbeans</H4>
    <p>This toolkit includes a Netbeans Plugin which you can use to further automate the connector construction process if you are a Netbeans user. The plugin is a visual 
    wrapper for the Ant-based Connector Creation Wizard that is provided with the toolkit. It will create and integrate skeleton connectors into the Netbeans environment
    based on your input. To install in Netbeans, simply choose <b>Tools -> Plugins</b>
    and switch to the "<b>Downloaded</b>" tab (since this is a downloaded plugin). Then just add the plugin from your toolkit directory (it is a ".nbm" file) and you're all set.</p>
    <p>To build a new connector you can now choose <b>Tools -> Connectors Toolkit</b>. Usage is simple:</p>
      <h5>Step 1: Set Properties</h4>
      <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Tell Netbeans where you extracted the Connectors Toolkit.</li>
        <li>Choose a directory in which to create your new connector.</li>
        <li>Enter the name of the <b>target resource</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter a package name for the generated classes (or use the default).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
      <h5>Step 2: Choose SPI Operations</h4>
    <p>All the SPI operations (authenticate, create, delete, etc.) are opt-in, so you may choose
      whichever ones your resource supports. When finished, click "Finish", and Netbeans will generate
      a skeleton connector implementing the interfaces you selected. It will also set up the necessary
      library and javadoc references as well. The new connector project will be automatically opened and
      at this point is ready for you to begin working on.
    </p>

    <h4>Other IDE's</h4>
    <P>The connector skeletons generated by this toolkit also include Eclipse <I>.project</I> and <I>.classpath</I> meta-files, which allows you to import your connector(s) directly into Eclipse and several other IDE's.</P>
    <P>The build dependencies are already set up; however, if you intend to use your IDE's JUnit runner, you'll need to set the System property "<B>project.name</B>" to the ant project name as
    defined in your connector's <I>build.xml</I> file. This is so that the TestHelpers class knows where to find any sensitive properties you have defined (see <A HREF="#Tests">Running Tests</A>).</P>
