	<H1>Developing Connector Bundles Manually</H1>
	<P>This document describes how to set up the basic build environment for developing
	connectors. This process can be greatly automated by using the <A HREF="Java_Toolkit.html">Java Toolkit</A> for Connectors.

	<H3>Getting Started</H3>
	<P>It's easy enough to simply checkout the entire source code base from
	<STRONG>https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/svn/identityconnectors/trunk/projects</STRONG>.
	However if you only intend to work on one connector, it's easier to
	just checkout the framework and the connector you're interested in.
	The current available connector implementations can be found under
	the "bundles" directory. 
	</P>
	<H3>Step 1: Checkout the code</H3>
	<P><B>(Entire Project):</B> </P> <P><PRE>svn checkout https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/svn/identityconnectors/trunk/projects 
      /your/sandbox</PRE></P>
  <P><B>(Framework Only):</B> </P> <P>  <CODE>svn checkout https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/svn/identityconnectors/trunk/projects/framework 
      /your/sandbox/<STRONG>framework</STRONG></CODE></P>     
  <P><B>(Specific Connector):</B>  </P> <P> 
      <code>svn checkout https://identityconnectors.dev.java.net/svn/identityconnectors/trunk/projects/bundles/<STRONG>specific-connector</STRONG> 
         /your/sandbox/<STRONG>bundles/specific-connector</STRONG>
      </CODE></P>
    <H3>Step 2: Before you build</H3>
	<P>Each connector, along with the framework, has its own <I>build.xml</I>
	file used to define the build rules. For the connectors, the build
	files simply reference a common build file in the framework.
	Currently this reference defaults to the location of the framework
	in the source tree. If you change the location of the framework you
	must set the ant property '<B>framework.dir</B>' in your build.xml.
	<P>Look at '<I>$framework/connector_build.xml</I>' for more info.
	Obviously, this property only applies to the connectors, not the
	framework itself. There are three additional (optional) build flags
	that can also be set in the same ways. These are:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>'<B>cobertura.home</B>'  (Install
		location of Cobertura, if you have it installed and are doing a
		coverage build)</P>
		<LI><P>'<B>findbugs.home</B>'  (Install
		location of FindBugs, if you have it installed and are doing code
		analysis)</P>
		<LI><P>'<B>external.reporting</B>'  (Boolean
		indicating whether there will be an external reporting engine used)
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P>These three apply to both the framework and any connectors that you might
	wish to enable them for as well.</P>
<P>JUnit tests cases are currently the only mechanism for exercising the framework and connector code. In order to run the test suites JUnit 4 must be in the Ant lib path. <b>Before building, you should copy the <I>junit4.jar</I> to your Ant lib directory.</b></P>
	<H3>Step 3: Build the framework</H3>
   <P>Navigate to the framework directory in your sandbox and list the contents:</P>
   <PRE>   $ cd /your/framework/location<BR>
   $ ls</PRE>

   <P>It should contain <I>build.properties</I>, <I>build.xml</I>, and <I>connector_build.xml</I>, as well as lib, test, and other directories. Then simply run Ant, specifying any desired arguments mentioned in Step 2 (remember, none are required to build the framework):<P>
   <PRE>   $ ant</PRE>

   <P><B>*Note:</B> If you use an IDE, make sure to build with Ant using the framework's custom <I>build.xml</I> file (in most IDE's you can click on the file and choose Run As-&gt;Ant Build), not just the standard <I>javac</I> that is usually run automatically. The build runs JUnit tests and creates reports, so if the JUnit jar is missing, the build will fail.</P>

	<H3>Step 4: Begin development on the target Connector</H3>
	<P>As mentioned before, the individual connectors have their own <I>build.xml </I>files and are built the same way as the framework, using Ant (again, specifying any necessary arguments from Step 2):</P> 
<PRE>   $ ant -Dframework.dir=/your/framework/location</PRE>
<P>If you use an IDE, you will want to add a reference to the framework project in each of the connector projects you are working on.
	The directory layout for a Connector is very simple and separates
	libraries and tests out by convention.</P> 
	<UL>
		<LI><B>src/</B> All java source (test
		included). 
	
		<LI><B>lib/</B> All distributed
		libraries (libraries included in the bundle). 

		<LI><B>lib/build/</B> Libraries only
		used during the build. 

		<LI><B>lib/test/</B> Libraries only
		used when running tests. 
	
		<LI><B>build.xml</B> Used to include
		the connector build from the framework and allow the connector
		developer to override anything in the build. 

		<LI><B>build.properties</B> Used to define all the properties of
		the connector bundle. 
	</UL>
	<P>All files in the 'src' directory will be compiled and included in
	the bundle, except those files that include <STRONG>Test</STRONG> in
	the name. All 'java' files that have <STRONG>Test</STRONG> in their
	name will be included in the test run except for the file named
	'AllTests.java'. 
	</P>
	<P>The 'lib' directory breaks down jar dependencies into three
	categories: distribution, build, and test. Any library that is
	required in the bundle must be at the top level in the lib
	directory. Jars in the 'lib/build' directory will be included in the
	path during compile and test. The jars in 'lib/test' will be
	included in the path for the JUnit run. 
	</P>
	<P>From Step 2, you will recall that a basic '<I>build.xml</I>' is
	there to include the '<I>connector_build.xml</I>' that is in the
	framework. The <I>build.properties</I> file is there to fill in the
	framework and version info for the bundle. Please refer to the
	<A HREF="connector_bundles.html">Connector
	Bundles</A> doc for more information on the properties. 
	</P>
	<H3>Development</H3>
	<P>The framework should stabilize soon such that there should be no more dramatic changes to the API or SPI. 
	</P>
