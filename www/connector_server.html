 <h1>Connector Servers</h1>
 <p>A connector server is required when a connector bundle is not directly executed within your 
 application.  By using one or more connector servers, the connector architecture thus permits your application to communicate with
 externally deployed bundles.<p>
 The use of connector servers is especially useful when an application
 is written in Java, but a connector bundle is written using C#.  Since a Java application
 (e.g. J2EE application) cannot load C# classes, it is necessary to instead deploy the C# bundles 
 under a C# connector server.  The Java application can communicate with the C# connector server
 over the network, and the C# connector server serves a proxy to provide to any authenticated application access to the C# bundles deployed
 within the C# connector server.
 <h2>Using SSL to communicate with connector servers</h2>
 The following steps are necessary to successfully communicate with a connector server using SSL:
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#deploy_cert">Deploy an SSL certificate </a>to connector server's system</li>
   <li><a href="#cs_ssl">Configure your connector server</a> to provide SSL sockets</li>
   <li><a href="#app_ssl">Configure your application </a>to communicate with the communicate with
       the connector server via SSL.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="deploy_cert">Deploying an SSL certificate</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Windows .NET connector server</li>
<li>Java connector server</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="cs_ssl">Configure your connector server to provide SSL sockets</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Windows .NET connector server</li>
<p>Edit the configuration file (ConnectorServer.exe.config) of your .NET connector server, changing:</p>
&nbsp;&lt;add key="connectorserver.usessl" value=<b>"false"</b>/><<br>
to this:<br>
&nbsp;&lt;add key="connectorserver.usessl" value=<b>"true"</b>/><<br>
<p>
<li>Java connector server</li>
<p>Edit the configuration file (e.g. connectorserver.properties) of your Java connector server, changing:</p>
&nbsp;connectorserver.usessl=<b>false</b><br>
to this:<br>
&nbsp;connectorserver.usessl=<b>true</b><br>
</ul>

<h3><a name="app_ssl">Configure your application to use SSL</a></h3>
Refer to your application manual for specific notes on how to configure connections to connector servers.
You will need to indicate to your application that an SSL connection is required when establishing a connection for each SSL-enabled connector server.<p>

Additionally, if any of the SSL certificates used by your connector servers is issued by a 
non-standard certificate authority, your application must be configured to respect the additional authorities.  Refer
to your application manual for notes regarding certificate authorities.<p>

Java applications may solve the non-standard certificate authority issue by expecting that the following
Java system properties are passed when launching the application:<br>
<ul>
<li>javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword</li>
For example, <b>-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit</b><br><br>
<li>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</li>
For example, <b>-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/usr/myApp_cacerts</b><br><br>
</ul>
<p>
Or, instead, the non-standard certificate authorities may be imported to the standard $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts.
