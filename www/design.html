<h1>Design Overview</h1>
<p>IdentityConnectors is designed to separate the implementation of an
application from the dependencies of the application or system it is
attempting to connect to. The IdentityConnectors framework provides a
container to separate the Connector bundle from the application. The
framework provides many common features that developers would otherwise need to
implement on their own. For instance the framework can provide
connection pooling, buffering, timeouts, and filtering. IdentityConnectors
is separated into two parts: the API, from which applications can call
Connectors, and the SPI, from which developers can create Connectors.

<h3>Connector SPI</h3>
<p>The Connector SPI is decomposed into several interfaces so that
the Connector developer only has to implement the interfaces that the
target application or system supports. The Connector API will still
provide a consistent view regardless of the interfaces the Connector
developer chooses to implement. The SPI is broken up into operations
(create, update, delete, search, etc.), features, and requirements. The
required interfaces include the <i>Connector</i> interface and the
<i>Configuration</i> interface. These interfaces must be implemented in order
for the API to understand which class contains the implementation of the
configuration and which contains the implementation of the operations.
The feature based interfaces at this time are the 'AttributeNormalizer'
and 'PoolableConnector' interfaces. The operation interfaces
determine the features the connector supports (such as <i>Create</i>, <i>Delete</i>, or
simply <i>Search</i>). Please see the Javadoc for more details.
<h3>Connector API</h3>
<p>The Connector API is responsible for presenting a consistent view
of a Connector regardless of the operations it has implemented. For the
convenience of the SPI developer there are several common features that
are provided right out of the box. For most of
these features there is no need for the API developer to handle them,
only configure them. Below is a list of features and their
explanation. The main features/concepts of the API are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Provide <b>Connection Pooling</b> to those Connectors that require
	it and avoid the API from seeing it, since not all Connectors have
	connections. In addition if the Connector uses Connection Pooling, it's
	not the responsibility of the API developer to handle the connections,
	nor dispose of them during error conditions.</li>
	<li>Provide <b>Timeouts</b> to all operations. The API consumer should
	only configure the appropriate timeout if the default is unacceptable.
	Each SPI developer should not have to implement such a common service
	and so it is implemented in the framework.</li>
	<li>Provide <b>Search Filtering</b> via a simple interface that accepts
	a large variety of filters. The Connector developer only needs to implement
	whichever filters the resource natively supports; the rest is handled by the framework.</li>
	<li>Provide <b>Search/Sync Buffering</b>, allowing queries and updates to be handled in chunks
	if need be. The application need not worry about this, as it is handled within the framework. </li>
	<li>Provide <b>Scripting</b> via Groovy and Boo .NET for Connectors. This will allow for great
	flexibility within a Connector, because the framework can execute scripts both on the connector
	and on the target resource (if supported).</li>
	<li>The SPI developer has the ability to choose <b>different
	implementations</b> of an operation. For instance there are two types of
	updates. This is hidden from the API consumer because there is no need
	for the API developer to have to call two different operations that
	essentially do the same thing. Instead the framework will figure which one (if either)
	the Connector supports and make the appropriate calls.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>There are no declared exceptions on any of the interfaces for either
the SPI or API.  At first this may seem strange but there is a method to the
madness. We concede the fact that at least one Connector implementation will
throw a RuntimeException intentionally or not. Also we'd like to encourage the
use of standard Java exceptions like IllegalArgumentException and 
IllegalStateException.  Also for the benefit of the debugging and logging we
like to encourage Connector developers to wrap their native exceptions in
a RuntimeException so exception data is not lost.
<p>Please see the Javadoc for more information.
