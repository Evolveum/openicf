 port | int | 23 | Port number used to communicate with the resource. This value may depend on the value of Connection Type. The standard value for telnet is 23; the standard value for SSH is 22
*-------------+----------+-------------+------------------+
 rootUser | String | | Leave this field blank if the user account entered in the Login User field has permission to manage this resource (create user accounts). Otherwise, enter the name of the user account that does have permission to manage this resource. This is often the root account. When connecting to this resource, the initial login is done as the Login User. If a Root User is specified, the su command is used to log in as the Root User before managing the resource.
*-------------+----------+-------------+------------------+
 credentials | GuardedString | | Password for the Root User account. Leave blank if the Root User field is blank.
*-------------+----------+-------------+------------------+

If a private key is specified, you must enter SSHPUBKEY as the value for the Connection Type field. Do not use this field if you implement password-based authentication. This attribute makes sense for ConnectionType#SSHPUBKEY.
*-------------+----------+-------------+------------------+
 passphrase | GuardedString | | Specify the passphrase, used during key generation. This attribute makes sense for ConnectionType#SSHPUBKEY
*-------------+----------+-------------+------------------+
