<!--
 What follows here is an example for the SAP Connector.
 
 This section assumes the following names:
 * connector-display-name: SAP Connector
 * connector-name: sap-connector
-->
 <title>SAP Connector Reference</title>

 <para>This chapter covers installation and configuration of the SAP  Connector.</para>

 <!--
 This chapter has at least a section on installing the connector, and another
 section on configuring the connector. If the connector schema can be read
 from the source, then this chapter also includes a schema section.

 If the connector has multiple implementations, then the chapter repeats the
 install, config, and schema sections for connector-display-name-1,
 connector-display-name-2, connector-display-name-3...

 Each section might be a separate XML file referenced with an <xinclude>
 element. However it is implemented, the chapter as a whole should be
 valid DocBook 5 XML.

 <!-- Hand-written instructions for installing the connector: -->

 <!-- The rest of the sections in this chapter are generated from source. -->
