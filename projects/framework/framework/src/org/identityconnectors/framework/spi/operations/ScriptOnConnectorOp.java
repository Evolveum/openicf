/**
  * Operation that runs a script in the environment of the connector.
 * (Compare to {@link ScriptOnResourceOp}, which runs a script
 * on the target resource that the connector manages.)
 * A connector that intends to <i>provide to scripts
 * more than is required by the basic contract</i>
 * specified in the javadoc for {@link ScriptOnConnectorApiOp} 
 * should implement this interface.
 * <p>
 * Each connector that implements this interface must support 
 * <em>at least</em> the behavior specified by {@link ScriptOnConnectorApiOp}. 
 * A connector also may expose additional variables for use by scripts
 * and may respond to specific {@link OperationOptions options}. 
 * Each connector that implements this interface 
 * must describe in its javadoc as available "for use by connector scripts"
 * any such additional variables or supported options.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: </b> It will be fairly typical for connectors to not need
 * to implement this method. Connectors may still expose features for
 * a script to use simply by having a method public. Those methods
 * that are intended for a script to be used should be documented
 * as "for use by connector scripts". Otherwise script authors
 * should not assume that the method is safe to be called from a script.
