This is the "Service Provider Interface" package.  The {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Connector} developer is responsible for implementing the following interfaces to build a {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Connector}.  First, one must implement the {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Configuration} interface.  The {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Configuration#validate} method is used to determine if the configuration information provided is valid.  The implementation should simply be a Java Bean.  There should be a getter and setter for each configuration property. For instance if the resource is a database some typical configuration information would include the JDBC driver, the host name of remote machine or the URL, and come credentials.  The getter should return the default value.  Second, one should implement the {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Connector} interface.  This interface insures proper initialization and disposal of the {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Connector}.  If the {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.Connector} developer would like the API to handle 'Connection Pooling' one must implement the {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.ConnectionFactory} interface.  Third, one should implement all the operations the resource can support like {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.operations.CreateOp}, {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.operations.UpdateOp}, {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.operations.DeleteOp}, {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.operations.SearchOp}, etc..
<p>
The operations package has many operations to choose from some do the something only more options.   For instance there are two search operations.  {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.operations.SearchOp} is the simplest.
