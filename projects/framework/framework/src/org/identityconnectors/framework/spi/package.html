This is the "Service Provider Interface" package.  The {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Connector} developer 
is responsible for implementing the following interfaces to build a {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Connector}.  
<ul>
<li>First, one must implement the {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Configuration} interface.  
The {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Configuration#validate} method is used to determine 
whether the configuration information that has been provided is valid.  The implementation should simply be a Java Bean.  
There should be a getter and setter for each configuration property. For instance, if the resource is a database instance 
then some typical configuration information would include the JDBC driver, the host name of remote machine or the URL, 
and some connection credentials.  The getter should return the default value.  
</li>
<li>Second, one should implement the {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Connector} interface.  
This interface insures proper initialization and disposal of the {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Connector}.  
If the {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.Connector} developer would like the API to handle 'Connection Pooling',
the Connector must implement the {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.PoolableConnector} interface.  
</li>
<li>Third, one should implement all the operations the resource can support, such as 
{@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations.CreateOp}, 
{@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations.UpdateOp}, 
{@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations.DeleteOp}, 
{@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations.SearchOp}, etc..
<p>
The {@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations operations} package 
has many operations from which to choose. In some cases, one operation does the same thing as another 
but exposes more options.   For instance there are two update operations.  
{@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations.UpdateOp} is simpler to implement than 
{@link org.identityconnectors.framework.spi.operations.AdvancedUpdateOp}.
