/**
 * A single-valued attribute that represents the <i>unique identifier</i> 
 * of an object within the name-space of the target resource. 
 * If possible, this unique identifier also should be immutable.
 * <p>
 * When an application creates an object on a target resource,
 * the {@link CreateApiOp#create create} operation 
 * returns as its result the <code>Uid</code> of the created object.
 * An application also can use the {@link SearchApiOp#search search} operation 
 * to discover the <code>Uid</code> value for an existing object.
 * An application must use the <code>Uid</code> value to identify the object
 * in any subsequent call to {@link GetApiOp#getObject get}, 
 * {@link DeleteApiOp#delete delete}
 * or {@link UpdateApiOp#update update} that object.
 * See the documentation for {@link Name} for comparison.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, the value of <code>Uid</code> would be a 
 * <i>Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID)</i>.  
 * However, not every target resource provides a globally unique 
 * and immutable identifier for each of its objects.
 * For some connector implementations, therefore, the <code>Uid</code>
 * value is only <i>locally</i> unique and may change when an object is modified.
 * For instance, an LDAP directory service that lacks GUID might use
 * <i>Distinguished Name (DN)</i> as the <code>Uid</code> for each object. 
 * A connector that represents each object as a row in a database table 
 * might use the value of the <i>primary key</i> as the <code>Uid</code> of an object.
 * The fact that changing an object might change its <code>Uid</code>
 * is the reason that {@link UpdateApiOp#update update} returns <code>Uid</code>. 
 * <p>
 * {@link Uid} by definition must be a single-valued attribute.
 * Its value must always convert to a string, 
 * regardless of the underlying type of the native identifier on the target.
 * The string value of any native id must be canonical.
 * <p>
 * Uid is never allowed to appear in the {@link Schema}, or in the attribute set of
 * a {@link Create} operation. This is because it is not a true attribute of an object, but
 * rather a reference to that object. It extends {@link Attribute} simply so that it can be searchable
 * and compatible with the filter translators.
