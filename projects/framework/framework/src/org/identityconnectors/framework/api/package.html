<title>Open Connectors API</title>
</head>
<body>
The Connector API presents a consistent view of each Connector 
regardless of which operations each connector implements. 
Common code implements the API in terms of the SPI,
providing consistent behavior and common features.
The developer of each Connector bundle implements (some subset of) the SPI,
and thus inherits a certain amount of common behavior "for free".

<p> For example, the common code that implements the API:
<ul>
        <li>Provides <em>connection pooling</em> to each <code>Connector</code> that requires it.
        Not every <code>Connector</code> needs connection pooling, 
        but those that do can "opt-in" simply by implementing
        {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.spi.ConnectionFactory a specific interface}.
        The calling application that uses the API does not need to do anything
        in order to enable connection pooling, but can 
        {@link com.sun.openconnectors.framework.api.APIConfiguration#getConnectionPoolingConfiguration configure connection pooling}.
        </li>

        <li>Provides <em>timeouts</em> for all <code>Connector</code> operations. 
        Common code provides this transparently to each implementation of the SPI.
        The API consumer may configure an appropriate timeout if the default is unacceptable.
        </li>

        <li>Provides <em>default implementations of advanced operations</em>.
        A <code>Connector</code> developer may implement either simple or advanced versions
        of certain operations such as update or search. 
        The API consumer sees only the advanced version of such operations,
        regardless of which version the <code>Connector</code> developer implements.
        </li>
</ul>
