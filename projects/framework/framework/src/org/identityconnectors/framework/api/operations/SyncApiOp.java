     * This allows a client to "pick up where he left off" in receiving synchronization events.

     * into a subsequent invocation of this {@code sync()} method.
     * This will return synchronization events (that represent native changes that
     * occurred) immediately subsequent to the event from which the client obtained the token.
     * <p>

     *            The {@code SyncResultsHandler} will return any number of
     *            {@linkplain SyncDelta} objects, each of which contains a token.
