/**
 * Secure byte array implementation that solves the problems associated with
 * keeping confidential data as <code>byte[]</code>. That is, anything 
 * represented as a <code>byte[]</code> is kept in memory in clear
 * text and stays in memory <b>at least</b> until it is garbage collected.
 * <p>
 * The GuardedByteArray class alleviates this problem by storing the bytes in
 * memory in an encrypted form. The encryption key will be a randomly-generated
 * key.
 * <p>
 * In their serialized form, GuardedByteArrays will be encrypted using a known
 * default key. This is to provide a minimum level of protection regardless
 * of the transport. For communications with the Remote Connector Framework
 * it is recommended that deployments enable SSL for true encryption.
 * <p>
 * Applications may also wish to persist GuardedByteArrays. In the case of 
 * Identity Manager, it should convert GuardedByteArrays to EncryptedData so
 * that they can be stored and managed using the Manage Encryption features
 * of Identity Manager. Other applications may wish to serialize APIConfiguration
 * as a whole. These applications are responsible for encrypting the APIConfiguration
 * blob for an additional layer of security (beyond the basic default key encryption
 * provided by GuardedByteArray).
