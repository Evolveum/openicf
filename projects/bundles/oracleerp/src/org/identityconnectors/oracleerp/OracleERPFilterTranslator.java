/**
 * This is an implementation of AbstractFilterTranslator that gives a concrete representation
 * of which filters can be applied at the connector level (natively). If the 
 * OracleErp doesn't support a certain expression type, that factory
 * method should return null. This level of filtering is present only to allow any
 * native contructs that may be available to help reduce the result set for the framework,
 * which will (strictly) reapply all filters specified after the connector does the initial
 * filtering.<p><p>Note: The generic query type is most commonly a String, but does not have to be.
