baseContextsToSynchronize.display=Base Contexts to Synchronize
baseContextsToSynchronize.help=One or more starting points in the LDAP tree that will be used to determine if a change should be synchronized. The base contexts attribute will be used to synchronize a change if this property is not set.
objectClassesToSynchronize.display=Object Classes to Synchronize
objectClassesToSynchronize.help=objectClassesToSynchronize.help=The object classes to synchronize. The change log is for all objects; this filters updates to just the listed object classes. You should not list the superclasses of an object class unless you intend to synchronize objects with any of the superclass values. For example, if only "inetOrgPerson" objects should be synchronized, but the superclasses of "inetOrgPerson" ("person", "organizationalperson" and "top") should be filtered out, then list only "inetOrgPerson" here. All objects in LDAP are subclassed from "top". For this reason, you should never list "top", otherwise no object would be filtered.
attributesToSynchronize.display=Attributes to Synchronize
attributesToSynchronize.help=The names of the attributes to synchronize. This ignores updates from the change log if they do not update any of the named attributes. For example, if only "department" is listed, then only changes that affect "department" will be processed. All other updates are ignored. If blank (the default), then all changes are processed.
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.display=Filter Out Changes By
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.help=The names (DNs) of directory administrators to filter from the changes. Changes with the attribute "modifiersName" that match entries in this list will be filtered out. The standard value is the administrator name used by this adapter, to prevent loops. Entries should be of the format "cn=Directory Manager".
accountSynchronizationFilter.display=LDAP Filter for Accounts to Synchronize
accountSynchronizationFilter.help=An optional LDAP filter for the objects to synchronize. Because the change log is for all objects, this filter updates only objects that match the specified filter. If you specify a filter, an object will be synchronized only if it matches the filter and includes a synchronized object class.
changeLogBlockSize.display=Change Log Block Size
changeLogBlockSize.help=The number of change log entries to fetch per query.
changeNumberAttribute.display=Change Number Attribute
changeNumberAttribute.help=The name of the change number attribute in the change log entry.
filterWithOrInsteadOfAnd.display=Filter with Or Instead of And
filterWithOrInsteadOfAnd.help=Normally the the filter used to fetch change log entries is an and-based filter retrieving an interval of change entries. If this property is set, the filter will or together the required change numbers instead.
removeLogEntryObjectClassFromFilter.display=Remove Log Entry Object Class from Filter
removeLogEntryObjectClassFromFilter.help=If this property is set (the default), the filter used to fetch change log entries does not contain the "changeLogEntry" object class, expecting that there are no entries of other object types in the change log.
