LdapConnector=LDAP Connector

# Configuration properties.
host.display=Host
host.help=The name or IP address of the host where the LDAP server is running.
port.display=TCP Port
port.help=TCP/IP port number used to communicate with the LDAP server.
ssl.display=SSL
ssl.help=Select the check box to connect to the LDAP server using SSL.
failover.display=Failover Servers
failover.help=List all servers that should be used for failover in case the preferred server fails. If the preferred server fails, JNDI will connect to the next available server in the list. List all servers in the form of "ldap://ldap.example.com:389/", which follows the standard LDAP v3 URLs described in RFC 2255. Only the host and port parts of the URL are relevant in this setting.
principal.display=Principal
principal.help=The distinguished name with which to authenticate to the LDAP server.
credentials.display=Password
credentials.help=Password for the principal.
baseContexts.display=Base Contexts
baseContexts.help=One or more starting points in the LDAP tree that will be used when searching the tree. Searches are performed when discovering users from the LDAP server or when looking for the groups of which a user is a member.
passwordAttribute.display=Password Attribute
passwordAttribute.help=The name of the LDAP attribute which holds the password. When changing an user's password, the new password is set to this attribute.
accountObjectClasses.display=Account Object Classes
accountObjectClasses.help=The object class or classes that will be used when creating new user objects in the LDAP tree. When entering more than one object class, each entry should be on its own line; do not use commas or semi-colons to separate multiple object classes. Some object classes may require that you specify all object classes in the class hierarchy.
accountUserNameAttributes.display=Account User Name Attributes
accountUserNameAttributes.help=Attribute or attributes which holds the account's user name. They will be used when authenticating to find the LDAP entry for the user name to authenticate.
accountSearchFilter.display=LDAP Filter for Retrieving Accounts
accountSearchFilter.help=An optional LDAP filter to control which accounts are returned from the LDAP resource. If no filter is specified, only accounts that include all specified object classes are returned.
groupMemberAttribute.display=Group Member Attribute
groupMemberAttribute.help=The name of the group attribute that will be updated with the distinguished name of the user when the user is added to the group.
maintainLdapGroupMembership.display=Maintain LDAP Group Membership
maintainLdapGroupMembership.help=When enabled and a user is renamed or deleted, update any LDAP groups to which the user belongs to reflect the new name. Otherwise, the LDAP resource must maintain referential integrity with respect to group membership.
maintainPosixGroupMembership.display=Maintain POSIX Group Membership
maintainPosixGroupMembership.help=When enabled and a user is renamed or deleted, update any POSIX groups to which the user belongs to reflect the new name. Otherwise, the LDAP resource must maintain referential integrity with respect to group membership.
passwordHashAlgorithm.display=Password Hash Algorithm
passwordHashAlgorithm.help=Indicates the algorithm that the Identity system should use to hash the password. Currently supported values are , , , and . A value of  or no value indicates that the system will not hash passwords. This will cause cleartext passwords to be stored in LDAP unless the LDAP server performs the hash (Netscape Directory Server and iPlanet Directory Server do).
respectResourcePasswordPolicyChangeAfterReset.display=Respect Resource Password Policy Change-After-Reset
respectResourcePasswordPolicyChangeAfterReset.help=When this resource is specified in a Login Module (i.e., this resource is a pass-through authentication target) and the resource''s password policy is configured for change-after-reset, a user whose resource account password has been administratively reset will be required to change that password after successfully authenticating.
useBlocks.display=Use Blocks
useBlocks.help=When performing operations on large numbers of accounts, the accounts are processed in blocks to reduce the amount of memory used by the operation. Select this option to process accounts in blocks.
blockSize.display=Block Size
blockSize.help=The maximum number of accounts that can be in a block when retrieving accounts in blocks.
usePagedResultControl.display=Use Paged Result Control
usePagedResultControl.help=When enabled, the LDAP Paged Results control is preferred over the VLV control when retrieving accounts.
vlvSortAttribute.display=VLV Sort Attribute
vlvSortAttribute.help=Specify the sort attribute to use for VLV indexes on the resource.
uidAttribute.display=Uid Attribute
uidAttribute.help=The name of the LDAP attribute which is mapped to the Uid attribute.
readSchema.display=Read Schema
readSchema.help=If true, the connector will read the schema from the server. If false, the connector will provide a default schema based on the object classes in the configuration. This property must be true in order to use extended object classes.
extendedObjectClasses.display=Extended Object Classes
extendedObjectClasses.help=Additional object classes to provide in the schema. If this property is not blank, the "readSchema" property must be set to true.
baseContextsToSynchronize.display=Base Contexts to Synchronize
baseContextsToSynchronize.help=One or more starting points in the LDAP tree that will be used to determine if a change should be synchronized. The base contexts attribute will be used to synchronize a change if this property is not set.
objectClassesToSynchronize.display=Object Classes to Synchronize
objectClassesToSynchronize.help=The object classes to synchronize. The change log is for all objects; this filters updates to just the listed object classes. You should not list the superclasses of an object class unless you intend to synchronize objects with any of the superclass values. For example, if only "inetOrgPerson" objects should be synchronized, but the superclasses of "inetOrgPerson" ("person", "organizationalperson" and "top") should be filtered out, then list only "inetOrgPerson" here. All objects in LDAP are subclassed from "top". For this reason, you should never list "top", otherwise no object would be filtered.
attributesToSynchronize.display=Attributes to Synchronize
attributesToSynchronize.help=The names of the attributes to synchronize. This ignores updates from the change log if they do not update any of the named attributes. For example, if only "department" is listed, then only changes that affect "department" will be processed. All other updates are ignored. If blank (the default), then all changes are processed.
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.display=Filter Out Changes By
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.help=The names (DNs) of directory administrators to filter from the changes. Changes with the attribute "modifiersName" that match entries in this list will be filtered out. The standard value is the administrator name used by this adapter, to prevent loops. Entries should be of the format "cn=Directory Manager".
accountSynchronizationFilter.display=LDAP Filter for Accounts to Synchronize
accountSynchronizationFilter.help=An optional LDAP filter for the objects to synchronize. Because the change log is for all objects, this filter updates only objects that match the specified filter. If you specify a filter, an object will be synchronized only if it matches the filter and includes a synchronized object class.
changeLogBlockSize.display=Change Log Block Size
changeLogBlockSize.help=The number of change log entries to fetch per query.
changeNumberAttribute.display=Change Number Attribute
changeNumberAttribute.help=The name of the change number attribute in the change log entry.
filterWithOrInsteadOfAnd.display=Filter with Or Instead of And
filterWithOrInsteadOfAnd.help=Normally the the filter used to fetch change log entries is an and-based filter retrieving an interval of change entries. If this property is set, the filter will or together the required change numbers instead.
removeLogEntryObjectClassFromFilter.display=Remove Log Entry Object Class from Filter
removeLogEntryObjectClassFromFilter.help=If this property is set (the default), the filter used to fetch change log entries does not contain the "changeLogEntry" object class, expecting that there are no entries of other object types in the change log.

AUTH_NO_USER_MATCHED=No user matched "{0}"
AUTH_FAILED=Authentication failed for "{0}"
AUTH_MORE_THAN_ONE_USER_MATCHED=More than one user matched "{0}", but none matched the password
AUTH_MORE_THAN_ONE_USER_MATCHED_WITH_PASSWORD=More than one user matched "{0}" and has the same password
