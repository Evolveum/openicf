 <h3>The MySQLUser connector specification</h3> 
    The connector capabilities are pretty limited. The connector supports just a user creation from modeluser template.
    The update is possible just for a user name and password. No other attributes are currently supported.
    The delete and search of user are also supported. 
    <br>
    The MySQLUSer connector uses the template user called the "modeluser".
    Model user and its rights are taken as a template for creating every new user on the MySQL resource.

 <h3>What kind of operations are supported by MySQLUser connector</h3> 
    The MySQLUser connector supports create, update, delete operation for the IdM account. Also search by user name are supported.
    The search by SQL user rights is currently not supported.       
 
 <h3>What kind of features are supported by MySQLUser connector</h3> 
    The MySQLUser does not support any of the special features except to set a new password. No enable/disable nor password expiration are supported.
    The connector does not support any scripting.
      
 <h3>Which version of framework?</h3> 
    The framework version 1.0 and above

 <h3>Backward compatible with adapter</h3>
    The connector is backward compatible with adapter. 
    All features from the adapter have been implemented except the "JDBC URL Template" property.
    The JDBC URL Template configuration property is not required, because all versions of MySQL 
    support the same URL schema.     

 <h3>What is the migration path from adapter to connector</h3>
    Please see the migration separate page.

 <h3>Native resource types the connector can manage</h3>
    The connector was tested against the mysql Upcoming Releases
    <ul>
     <li>MySQL 6.0 — Alpha</li>
     <li>MySQL 5.0 — Previous GA release</li>
     <li>MySQL 4.1 — Previous GA release</li>
    </ul>

 <h3>The MySQL resource description</h3>
    Provides implementation of connector to MySQL database resource. 
    MySQL Connector uses MySQL database mysql.user table to manage users. There could be a multiple records for particular
    user. The unique key of the record is a sequence of host, user, schema, table. The rest of the record consist of 
    encoded user password and SQL user rights.<br> 
    The MySQL resource accepts the % wildcard. This wildcard can be used for specifying any host, any user, any schema, any table.

 <h3>The MySQL resource restrictions</h3>
    The user account must have right to read, create, update and delete the users from any hosts and for any schema and table. 
    The modeluser can have any rights. Use of same account for user and modeluser is not recommended and can lead to problems.
    <br>
    The MySQL connector does not difference between the hosts. Every access right is considered valid from any host.
    It must imply the default wildcard "%" for hosts. It is not recommended to set up the model user with different 
    SQL access rights which differs just in host.
