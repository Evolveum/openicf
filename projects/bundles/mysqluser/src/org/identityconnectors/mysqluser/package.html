    The delete and search of user is also supported. 
    <BR>
    The MySQLUSer connector use the template user called the "modeluser".
    Model user and its rights are taken taken as a template for creating every new user on the MySQL resource.

    To search by SQL user rights currently is not supported.

    The MySQLUser does not support any of the special features except to set a new password. No enable/disable nor password expiration are supported.
    The connector does not support any scripting.
      
 <P2>Which version of framework?</P2> 
    The framework version 1.0 and above

 <P2>Backward compatible with adaptor</P2>
    The connector is backward compatible with adaptor. 
    All features from the adapter has been implemented exept the "JDBC URL Template" property.
    The JDBC URL Template configuration property is not required, because all versions of MySQL 
    supports the same URL schema.     

 <P2>What is the migration path from adapter to connecto</P2>
    Please see the migration separate page.

 <P2>Native resource types the connector can manage</P2>
    The connector was tested against the mysql Upcoming Releases
    <ul>
     <li>MySQL 6.0 — Alpha</li>
     <li>MySQL 5.0 — Previous GA release</li>
     <li>MySQL 4.1 — Previous GA release</li>
    </ul>

 <P2>The MySQL resource description</P2>
    Provides implementation of connector to MySQL database resource. 
    MySQL Connector uses MySQL database mysql.user table to manage users. There could be a multiple records for particular
    user. The unique key of the record is a sequence of host, user, schema, table. The rest of the record consist of 
    encoded user password and SQL user rights.<br> 
    The MySQL resource accepts the % wildcard. This wildcard can be used for specifying any host, any user, any schema, any table.

 <P2>The MySQL resource restrictions</P2>
    The user account must have rights to read, create, update and delete the users from any hosts and for any schema and table. 
    The modeluser can have any rights. To use the same account for user and modeluser is not recommended and can leads to problems.
    <BR>
    The MySQL connector does not difference between the hosts. Every access rights is considered as valid from any hosts.
    It must imply the default wildcard "%" for hosts. It is not recommended to set up the model user with different 
    SQL access rights which differs for hosts.
