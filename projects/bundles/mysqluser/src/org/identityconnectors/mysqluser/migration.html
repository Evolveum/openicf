		<h2>Differences between MySQLResourceAdapter and MySQLUserConnector</h2>
        <h3>Run the conversion task</h3>
        The new "MySQL Conversion Utility" server task will convert adapter to connector. 
		<h3>Configuration properties</h3>
		All configuration properties are supported except the "JDBC URL Template".
		<br/>
		The "JDBC URL Template" is the same for all supported MySQL databases.
		Lets set to the MySQLUserConector configuration the same values as they are in the Adapter.
        <br/>
        The newly supported are DataSource name and jndiProperties. 
        <br>        
        When new datasource is configured, the user, host, password and port could be left empty.
