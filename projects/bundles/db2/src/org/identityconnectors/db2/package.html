 Provides implementation of connector to DB2 database resource. 
 DB2 Connector uses DB2 database resource to manage users. DB2 uses external authentication provider and internal authorization service.
 DB2 connector is then pretty limited and should be used with combination of underlying authorization service connector, typically
 OS connector or LDAP. DB2 connector stores users using passed grants. 
 
 See {@link org.identityconnectors.db2.DB2Configuration} and  {@link org.identityconnectors.db2.DB2Connector} for more information about DB2 connector.
