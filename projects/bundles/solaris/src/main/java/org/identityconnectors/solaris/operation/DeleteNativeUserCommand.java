                 * Initial state: originally we were throwing just ConnectorException here, because we 
                 * assumed that if Expect4j matches, "ERROR", this means that none of other more specific
                 * messages have been in the response. This assumption turned out to be wrong, thus we 
                 * introduced the following change: 
                 * 
                 * Change description: we need to do an extra check of the buffer, if the buffer 
                 * doesn't contain reject strings for more specific exceptions, that deserve 
                 * UnknownUidException to be thrown.
                 * 
                 * Original motivation of this extra check:
                 * Random errors in contract tests can occur because the wrong exception type is thrown.
                 * 
                 * How the error happens:
                 * Expect4J reads the response from the resource partially (for instance just the start 
                 * of the error message, containing "ERROR"), so will invoke the Closure for generic error
                 * message, instead of the specific one. 
                 * After Expect invokes the closure, the SolarisConnection marks, which error message was matched.
                 * If an error messages is matched, SolarisConnection will try to read as much of the response, as it can.
                 * This is were the connection comes to know the remaining part of the error message, 
                 * which can contain the specific information we miss.
                 * So even though Expect4j matched the generic message, based on full buffer content 
                 * we need to throw a specific error message.
