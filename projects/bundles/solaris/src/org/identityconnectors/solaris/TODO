This connector is under development, it is not release ready.

TODOs:
* test against other unix flavours, e.g. HPUX, Linux (RedHat, SUSE), possible SecurId, Aix, NIS.
* getConnectorMessages() -- organize message propeties, so they are optimal for localization

HINTS from SolarisRA:
* // Depending on the amount of data to modify, userAttribParams
  // could push the input beyond what the shell can handle so
  // we break up the input to allow for this.
  
  ================================================
  
  try to reproduce the 'echo "Hello world"' -- inspire from VMS code.
  == try to detect, what was sent back.
