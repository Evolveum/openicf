This connector is under development, it is not release ready.

TODOs:
* test against other unix flavours, e.g. HPUX, Linux (RedHat, SUSE), possible SecurId, Aix, NIS.

HINTS from SolarisRA:
* // Depending on the amount of data to modify, userAttribParams
  // could push the input beyond what the shell can handle so
  // we break up the input to allow for this.
