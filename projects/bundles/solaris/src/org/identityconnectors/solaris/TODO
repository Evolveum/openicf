This connector is under development, it is not release ready.

TODOs:
* test against other unix flavours, e.g. HPUX, Linux (RedHat, SUSE), possible SecurId, Aix, NIS.
* getConnectorMessages() -- organize message propeties, so they are optimal for localization
* add delete supporting deletion of nonexisting accounts.
* DELETE: handle the option, whe the user is logged in, at it can't be deleted:
     root@prgvm8092:~# userdel sample
     UX: userdel: ERROR: sample is in use.  Cannot remove it.

!!! ** finish the create process, including authentication!!!

HINTS from SolarisRA:
* // Depending on the amount of data to modify, userAttribParams
  // could push the input beyond what the shell can handle so
  // we break up the input to allow for this.
