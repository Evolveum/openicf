This connector is under development, it is not release ready.

TODOs:

* UPDATE:
  - clarify meaning of 'newName' attribute sent into SRA#getUpdateNativeUserScript() and implement it. 

*** SolarisConnection
 *** - try out SSHPubKeyAuthentication.
 
* DELETE: handle the option, whe the user is logged in, at it can't be deleted:
     root@prgvm8092:~# userdel sample
     UX: userdel: ERROR: sample is in use.  Cannot remove it.
  * support deletion of groups - is this inclusive delete? (the accounts of that group should be deleted?) 

* consider issuing an echo "abc" before every command is started.
     
 low priority:
* getConnectorMessages() -- organize message propeties, so they are optimal for localization

====================================
HINTS from SolarisRA:
* // Depending on the amount of data to modify, userAttribParams
  // could push the input beyond what the shell can handle so
  // we break up the input to allow for this.
  
* is it possible to create a user based on a commmon template, or to edit it?

====================================  
Adapter's features:
  
  -- SolarisRA indicates if shell is set to a nonexisting type.
     -- com.waveset.util.WavesetException: An error occurred modifying 
        user 'roman' on resource 'Solaris'. com.waveset.util.WavesetException: 
        UX: usermod: ERROR: /bin/ABCDEFsh is not a valid shell. Choose another.
  -- **VERY GOOD FEATURE** -- SolarisRA's ScriptedConnection#refreshUnprocessedInput()
        provides returning of unprocessed input from the resource. This way, if you put
        a breakpoint at WavesetException and try to set a nonsense shell /bin/bbbsh 
        ScriptedConnection *directly* warns you about his fact. VERY COOL! Can I have this in Connector + Expect4J?
