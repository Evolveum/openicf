This connector is under development, it is not release ready.

TODOs:
* add delete supporting deletion of nonexisting accounts.
* DELETE: handle the option, whe the user is logged in, at it can't be deleted:
     root@prgvm8092:~# userdel sample
     UX: userdel: ERROR: sample is in use.  Cannot remove it.
* delete does not throw UnknownUidException.
* consider issuing an echo "abc" before every command is started.
     
 low priority:
* getConnectorMessages() -- organize message propeties, so they are optimal for localization

HINTS from SolarisRA:
* // Depending on the amount of data to modify, userAttribParams
  // could push the input beyond what the shell can handle so
  // we break up the input to allow for this.
  
  ================================================
  * is it possible to create a user based on a commmon template, or to edit it?
