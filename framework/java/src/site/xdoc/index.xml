  <section name="About the OpenICF Project">
   <p>An ICF Connector allows provisioning software such as OpenIDM
       to manage identities maintained by a specific identity provider.
       ICF connectors provide a consistent layer between target resources
       and applications and expose a set of programming functions for the
       full lifecycle of an identity. ICF connectors are by design compatible with OpenIDM,
       Sun Identity Manager and Oracle Waveset as well as Brinqa GRC Platform.</p>
