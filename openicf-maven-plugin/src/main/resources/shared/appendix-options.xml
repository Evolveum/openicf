 <title>OpenICF Operation Options</title>

 <para>
  This chapter describes all of the predefined operation options by the OpenICF
  framework, along with notes about their use. Specific connectors
  may support only a subset of these options.
 </para>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-scope">
        <title>Scope</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Search (in conjunction with <link linkend="operation-option-container">Container</link>) that specifies how far
            beneath the specified container to search. Must be one of the following values:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>SCOPE_OBJECT</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>SCOPE_ONE_LEVEL</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>SCOPE_SUBTREE</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-container">
        <title>Container</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Search that specifies the container under which to perform the search. Must be of type QualifiedUid. Should be
            implemented for those object classes whose ObjectClassInfo.isContainer() returns true.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-run-as-user">
        <title>Run as User</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Script on Resource and possibly others that specifies an account under which to execute the script/operation. The specified
            account will appear to have performed any action that the script/operation performs.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-run-with-password">
        <title>Run with Password</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Script on Resource and possibly others that specifies a password under which to execute the script/operation.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-attributes-to-get">
        <title>Attributes to Get</title>
        <para>
            Determines which attributes to retrieve during Search and Sync.
            This option overrides the default behavior, which is for the connector to return exactly the set of
            attributes that are identified as returned by default in the schema for that connector.

            This option allows a client application to request additional attributes that would not otherwise not be
            returned (generally because such attributes are more expensive for a connector to fetch and to format)
            and/or to request only a subset of the attributes that would normally be returned.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-paged-results-cookie">
        <title>Paged Results Cookie</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Search that specifies an opaque cookie which is used by the connector to track its position in the set of query
            results.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-paged-results-offset">
        <title>Paged Results Offset</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Search that specifies the index within the result set of the first result which should be returned.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-page-size">
        <title>Page Size</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Search that specifies the requested page results page size.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="operation-option-sort-keys">
        <title>Sort Keys</title>
        <para>
            An option to use with Search that specifies the sort keys which should be used for ordering the ConnectorObject returned by search
            request.
        </para>
    </section>
